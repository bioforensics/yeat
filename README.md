## Intro

YEAT (**Y**our **E**verday **A**ssembly **T**ool) is a platform designed for end-to-end processing of genome assemblies with support for multiple technologies and read types (both short and long). It utilizes a Snakemake workflow to orchestrate data quality control, execution of one or more assembly algorithms, post-assembly quality control, and visualization. YEAT can be configured for one or more samples, one or more assembly algorithms per sample, and one or more parameter sets per algorithm. Deployment in an HPC environment can accelerate workflow processing by executing independent tasks in parallel.

## Help

YEAT documentation is available on the [YEAT GitHub wiki](https://github.com/bioforensics/yeat/wiki).
